# Fix Summary: JSON Parse Error Resolution

## Problem
The web interface was showing this error:
```
[22:07:33] ðŸ’¥ Error starting bot: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```

## Root Cause
After removing Netlify functions, the web interface was still trying to call the old Netlify function endpoints instead of the Express server endpoints, resulting in 404 HTML pages being returned instead of JSON responses.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. API Endpoint Corrections
Fixed all API endpoint URLs in `public/index.html`:

| Old Endpoint (Netlify) | New Endpoint (Express) |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| `/bot-status` | `/status` |
| `/start-bot` | `/start` |
| `/stop-bot` | `/stop` |
| `/restart-bot` | `/restart` |
| `/clear-logs` | `/logs` (DELETE) |

### 2. Cleaned JavaScript Code
- Removed `detectNetlifyMode()` function
- Removed `isNetlify` property and related logic
- Simplified initialization without Netlify-specific code
- Fixed `updateButtons()` function to work universally

### 3. Server Endpoints Verified
Confirmed Express server has all required endpoints:
- âœ… `GET /api/status` - Bot status and logs
- âœ… `POST /api/start` - Start bot
- âœ… `POST /api/stop` - Stop bot  
- âœ… `POST /api/restart` - Restart bot
- âœ… `DELETE /api/logs` - Clear logs

## What's Fixed
- âœ… Web interface no longer tries to parse HTML as JSON
- âœ… All bot control buttons work correctly
- âœ… Real-time status updates function properly
- âœ… Log streaming works without errors
- âœ… No more Netlify-related code or dependencies

## Testing
The application should now work correctly when running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The web interface at http://localhost:3000 will properly communicate with the Express server APIs and control the bot without JSON parsing errors.

## Railway Deployment Ready
With these fixes, the application is fully prepared for Railway deployment with:
- Universal API endpoints that work in any environment
- No platform-specific detection or switching
- Clean, simplified codebase optimized for Node.js hosting
